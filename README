# Using LSA and related techniques to efficently search the emails released in the Hacking Team data dump  #

## Dependencies:
	-) libicu
	-) libxml2
	-) eigen3


## NOTE: still a work in progress #

## Goals:
	-) Links to download the coordinate representation of the sparce matricies for each person (if you dont want to download the emails)
	-) SVD of emails for each person
	-) simple binary that takes input arguement of search terms and outputs documets that are most related by some distance measurment (cos(theta) probably)
